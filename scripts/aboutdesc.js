        My name is Andrew Lambert, and I’m a 21-year-old developer with a lifelong passion for 
        technology and programming. My journey started when I was 13, developing games on Roblox 
        using a scripting language called Lua. What began as a curiosity about creating virtual worlds 
        quickly turned into a deeper fascination with building interactive experiences that connect people. 
        Over the years, I collaborated with other developers and led projects that taught me the value of
        teamwork and creative problem-solving. One of my proudest moments came in 2019 when I contributed to
        Granny by GabStudio—a game that reached over 700 million visits. Though it was eventually taken down 
        due to copyright issues, the experience left a lasting impression and helped shape the developer 
        I am today. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Wayne State University. 
        During college, I focused on expanding both my technical skills and my understanding of real-world 
        application development. I immersed myself in modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        and built interactive user interfaces with ReactJS. I also dove into backend development using 
        Node.js and database management with MongoDB, gaining experience in full-stack application design. 
        My passion lies in creating intuitive, polished, and functional digital products that bridge the gap 
        between thoughtful design and seamless usability. Beyond coding, I make time for the things that keep me 
        balanced and motivated. I work out regularly to stay physically and mentally sharp, especially during long 
        periods of deep focus on projects. I find peace in driving—it helps clear my mind and offers a sense of 
        freedom I often draw creative energy from. Video games are another important part of my life—not just 
        for fun, but as a source of inspiration and a way to explore how great design and mechanics can shape 
        user experience. Music is always in the background, fueling my flow whether I’m coding, brainstorming, 
        or unwinding after a busy day. For me, programming is more than a skill—it’s a form of self-expression. 
        It allows me to build things that make life easier, more enjoyable, and more connected. As I transition 
        from student to professional, I’m excited about the road ahead: collaborating with passionate developers, 
        tackling real-world challenges, and contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact. My ultimate 
        goal is to grow as a front-end developer and continue building accessible, visually engaging, and 
        responsive experiences that people truly enjoy using.
