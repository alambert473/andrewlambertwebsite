        My name is Andrew Lambert, and I am a 21-year-old male passionate about technology and programming.
        I began coding at the age of 13 on a platform called Roblox, which uses a scripting language called
        Lua.
        At the time, I was fascinated by the ability to create virtual worlds where people could play,
        explore, and connect.
        Over the years, I developed multiple games and collaborated with other developers to bring ideas to
        life. In 2019, I
        contributed to a game titled Granny by GabStudio, which amassed over 700 million visits, marking one
        of my proudest accomplishments
        as a young developer. Unfortunately, the game was later taken down due to copyright issues, but the
        experience taught me invaluable
        lessons about creativity, teamwork, and perseverance.

        I am currently a college student studying Computer Science at Wayne State University and set to
        graduate in May 2025. My education
        has been a journey of continuous growth, and I've gained a deep understanding of both the theory and
        application of programming concepts.
        I've honed my skills in modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        frameworks like ReactJS. I've also explored
        backend development with Node.js and database management using MongoDB, which has allowed me to
        build full-stack applications. My passion lies
        in crafting intuitive and seamless user experiences that bridge the gap between functionality and
        design.

        Outside of coding, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that keep me balanced and motivated. I regularly
        work out to maintain both physical and mental
        health, which helps me stay focused during long coding sessions. Driving is another passion of mine,
        as I find peace and freedom on the open road.
        I also enjoy playing video games—not only for fun but to analyze game mechanics and draw inspiration
        for my own projects. Music is a constant
        companion in my life, providing both motivation and relaxation—whether it's lo-fi beats while coding
        or upbeat tracks while working out.

        Over the years, I've realized that programming is not just a skill but an art form. It allows me to
        create solutions, tell stories, and
        innovate in ways that impact people's lives. As I look ahead to graduation, I'm excited about
        opportunities to collaborate with like-minded
        developers, tackle new challenges, and contribute to meaningful projects in the tech industry. My
        ultimate goal is to become a front-end developer,
        crafting accessible, responsive, and visually appealing digital experiences that leave a lasting
        impression.
